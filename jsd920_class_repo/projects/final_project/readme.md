# Project Overview

## Project Description

I want to create an interactive version of a film project I made a few years ago. The concept behind the film is that it's someone's birthday everydayâ€“ and there are celebrations happening that we're not privy to in our daily lives. I was also fascinated to see how many birthday-related videos are uploaded to youtube. 

Instead of a static video, I'd like to create an app where the user can toggle through videos that are being pulled in realtime from YouTube based on queries I control. I want the app to look like a home movie: with a date counter in the upper righthand corner, title in the upper left.

## Functional Components

* Use the YouTube API to pull videos
* If possible, load multiple videos at once so the playback time is fast
* Program arrow keys to move backwards/forward through video stream
* Load title and date of video
