# Project Overview

## Project Description
I want to create an interactive version of a film project I made a few years ago. The concept behind the film is that it's someone's birthday everydayâ€“ and there are celebrations happening that we're not privy to in our daily lives. I was also fascinated to see how many birthday-related videos are uploaded to YouTube.

Instead of a static video, I'd like to create an app where the user can toggle through videos that are being pulled in realtime from YouTube based on queries I control. I want the app to look like a home movie: with a date counter in the upper righthand corner, title in the upper left.


## Functional Components
### Required
1) Use the YouTube API to pull video source URL and title | 2-4 hours
2) Add video to the background of the site (fullscreen) | 1-2 hours
3) Display title of video (title will be a date) in mm/dd/yy format | 2-4 hours
4) Program left and right arrow keys to move backwards/forward through video stream | 1-2 hours
5) Host the site | 0.5-1 hours

### Nice to Have
* If a video has been played, don't play it again (unless there are no other query results) | 2-4 hours
* Only include February 29 every 4 full 'years' | 1-2 hours

### Bonus
* If possible, optimize playback time by pre-loading upcoming video | 6-8 hours
