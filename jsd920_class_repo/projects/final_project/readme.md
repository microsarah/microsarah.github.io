# Project Overview

## Project Description
I want to create an interactive version of a film project I made a few years ago. The concept behind the film is that it's someone's birthday everydayâ€“ and there are celebrations happening that we're not privy to in our daily lives. I was also fascinated to see how many birthday-related videos are uploaded to YouTube.

Instead of a static video, I'd like to create an app where the user can toggle through videos that are being pulled in realtime from YouTube based on queries I control. I want the app to look like a home movie: with a date counter in the upper righthand corner, title in the upper left.

## Functional Components

// break down into priorities & time frames

* Use the YouTube API to pull videos and add them to the background of the site
* Use data from the YouTube API to load title and date of video
* Program arrow keys to move backwards/forward through video stream
* If a video has been played, don't play it again (unless there are no other query results)
* Only include February 29 every 4 full plays
* If possible, optimize playback time by pre-loading upcoming video

## Helper Functions
Use this section to document all helper functions. These functions should be versatile enough to be reused in other projects

// make a function that pulls videos from a site
// make a function that loads videos into the background of site
