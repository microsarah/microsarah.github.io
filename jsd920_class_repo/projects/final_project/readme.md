# Project Overview

## Project Description

I want to create an interactive data visualization for GA's online courses. We track project completion, course completion, NPS, and student utilization (how often they meet with instructors); as well as milestones marking different changes we've made in the courses. Currently we have 5 coursesâ€“ so I'd like the ability to look at certain measures all at once, as well as isolate a single course.

## Functional Components

First work with one course's data, then scale.

* Use d3.js to visualize all milestones & data
* Hover on data for more information
* Filter data using checkboxes
* Export visualizations to JPG
* If possible, regularly pull data from repository
